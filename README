Math-StochasticProcess

This set of modules is designed to faciliate the calculation of probabilities
and expected values of stochastic processes. The basic module is the Math::StochasticProcess::Event,
from which you derive classes which specify which Events follow from a given Event and by which probability.
Critically this class has an "isResolved" virtual method. You kick off the module by
creating a Math::StochasticProcess object. Its constructor takes as its argument a seed
Event and a tolerance. When run, the PEA iterates until all events are resolved.

As an added convenience one may use the Math::StochasticProcess::Event::Tuple class which derives from the Event class.
This represents a tuple of random variables. This defines all undefined base functions,
apart from "iterate" which actually defines what how an Event moves to the next iteration.
